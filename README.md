# Hi there, I'm Hung 👋

I'm an undergraduate student at University of Engineering and Technology - VNU, passionate about offensive security and always eager to learn more.

## I'm interested in

- **Binary Exploitation (pwn)** - My main focus in CTFs.
- **Vulnerability Research** - My goal is to discover a 0day 1 day :)

I'm self-taught and still learning every day. I love to understand software security at a deeper level.

## My blog - [ngtuonghung.github.io](https://ngtuonghung.github.io/)

I write about my journey and share what I learn:
- **CTFs** writeups (pwnable challenges only).
- **CVEs** in details and how to reproduce them.
- Pentesting walkthroughs.
